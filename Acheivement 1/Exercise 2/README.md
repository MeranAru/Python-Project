# Exercise 2

## Create a structure
A recipe book needed to be made and created a structure with name, cooking time and ingredients

## Create an outer structure
For the recipe we needed to put the recipe into a category which was all_recipe

## Create more recipes
Needed to create 5 more recipes and add to the category all_recipe

## Reason for choosing structure
Dictionaries for individual recipes make sense due to their ability to hold key-value pairs (like name, cooking_time, and ingredients), making the data easily accessible and manageable
